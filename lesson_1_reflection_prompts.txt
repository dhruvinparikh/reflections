How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

    I was able to identify the typo. 

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

    I would be able to fix the bug and restore the file from any version.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

    Pros are there would not be extra files saved and demerit would be changes' log are not recorded. 

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

    The google docs are basically rich text editor where as git is actually made for version-control.

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

    for mac use git log on terminal

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

    it makes confident as the log is simultaneously saved for the difference if any.

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

    I want to do hands on.
